# 👋 Hi, I'm William Anton

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a career-changer and self-taught developer with a background in wine production, manufacturing, and logistics — now exploring the world of web development and data tools.

🚴‍♂️ I'm passionate about:
- Learning new technologies through hands-on projects
- Building useful tools with Python, React, and Django
- Tracking performance and trends in cycling and fitness
- Helping demystify baking and wine through simple, elegant applications
